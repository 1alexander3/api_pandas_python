This Python program uses a YouTube api key to collect Id, Title, Upload Date, Views, Likes, and Comments from 10 videos.

Limiting the pull to 10 videos is to prevent long wait times, and to account for operational systems that can not handle large volumes of data.

Future Improvements:

Customizing the number of videos pulled

Retrieving more information such as Channel Name and Video Length

Selecting the top liked comment
